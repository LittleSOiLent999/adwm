* [x] fix focus problems
* [x] do code cleanup

Window resize grips:

      the frame window.
* [ ] add ability to have resize grips all the way around the window in
      DTWM/MWM/TWM/CTWM/VTWM fashion

Decoration styles:

* [ ] use imlib2 to optimally update exposures on the frame
* [ ] convert as many gradients as possible to use imlib2
* [ ] make imlib2 a prerequisite
* [ ] display icons in title bar
* [ ] provide a different button pressed pixmap for each mouse button.

Internal layout mechanism:

      and vim modes
* [ ] apply tree format to floating windows and floating window placement.

      for tiled layout

Session control:

* [ ] fixup restart behaviour
* [ ] add session management
* [ ] implement separate file for dock app list.
* [ ] implement function to save dock app list.

Behaviour:

* [x] showing desktop mode in fluxbox(1) is per desktop, we should do
      the same and make showing desktop mode only apply to a view.

* [ ] when resizing windows frame is resizing faster than the client
      (due to synchronization).  Change resizing behaviour to not resize
      the frame until the client responds to the resize request.
      (Not sure I want to do this one: current behaviour is ok.)

* [x] implement lhalf and rhalf button functions.
* [ ] switch to lhalf or rhalf at screen/monitor edges (no _Ctrl_ key).
* [x] defeat snap when moving with _Ctrl_ key.
* [ ] move window to adjacent desktop at screen/monitor edges (_Ctrl_
      key depressed.
* [x] implement kill behavior with _Button2_ and _Button3_ on close
      button.
