Behaviour:

* [x] showing desktop mode in fluxbox(1) is per desktop, we should do
      the same and make showing desktop mode only apply to a view.

* [x] when resizing windows frame is resizing faster than the client
      (due to synchronization).  Change resizing behaviour to not resize
      the frame until the client responds to the resize request.
      (Not sure I want to do this one: current behaviour is ok.)
