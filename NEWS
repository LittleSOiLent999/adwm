---------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.7.10

0.7.10          Maintenance Release 0.7.10

    This is another release of the adwm window manager that provdes a fully
    XDG, WindowMaker, WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCM 2.0 compliant
    tiling/floating window manager. It borrows concepts from dwm(1),
    velox(1), awesome(1), spectrwm(1) and wmii(1).

    This is a maintenance release that fixes a number of issues, provides
    full support for compilation with -Wextra flag. Although this release
    provides some significant development of X11R6 session management
    capabilities, those capabilities are not yet used. There are no
    outstanding issues at the time of release, and the next release should
    include some outstanding development from the TODO list.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.

Release adwm-0.7.4 released 2018-05-29
--------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.7.4

0.7.4           Maintenance Release 0.7.4

    This maintenace release fixes a couple of noxious bugs, one that has
    been hanging around for quite a while (a double blocking wait() on a
    SIGCHLD: which cause the window manager to some times lock up when an
    adopted child exited, depending on timing.  This was keeping adwm from
    starting up properly when other children are coming and going.

    Because this was fixed, adwm now grabs the server when scanning for
    existing clients on startup.  Not grabbing the server (because of the
    first bug) caused adwm to crash on xerrors sometimes on startup when
    windows were appearing and disappearing while scanning (such as during
    autostart).  The server is now grabbed during initial startup scanning.

    Another was not performing startup notification completion for itself
    even though it reports StartupNotify=true in its XSession .desktop file.

    Another was that adwm left dockapp top-level windows annoyingly mapped
    if the dockapp was started before the window manager, or on restart
    where dockapps toplevel windows would be mapped during the restart.  Now
    dockapp top-level windows are unmapped whenever they are managed.  (It
    is the icon-window that needs to be mapped, not the top-level window.)

    With these fixes adwm not starts up nicely under the xdg-launch simple
    session manager that is about to be released and the soon to be finished
    xde-session full blown session manager.

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 0.7.3...0.7.4

Brian Bidulock <bidulock@openss7.org> (7):
      yes, grab server for scan
      add startup notification completion for wm itself
      warn when not using prctl
      never block on wait
      do not handle core-dumpers
      unmap dockapp window
      update release files
