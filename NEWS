Release adwm-0.7.4 released 2018-05-29
--------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.7.4

0.7.4           Maintenance Release 0.7.4

    This maintenace release fixes a couple of noxious bugs, one that has
    been hanging around for quite a while (a double blocking wait() on a
    SIGCHLD: which cause the window manager to some times lock up when an
    adopted child exited, depending on timing.  This was keeping adwm from
    starting up properly when other children are coming and going.

    Because this was fixed, adwm now grabs the server when scanning for
    existing clients on startup.  Not grabbing the server (because of the
    first bug) caused adwm to crash on xerrors sometimes on startup when
    windows were appearing and disappearing while scanning (such as during
    autostart).  The server is now grabbed during initial startup scanning.

    Another was not performing startup notification completion for itself
    even though it reports StartupNotify=true in its XSession .desktop file.

    Another was that adwm left dockapp top-level windows annoyingly mapped
    if the dockapp was started before the window manager, or on restart
    where dockapps toplevel windows would be mapped during the restart.  Now
    dockapp top-level windows are unmapped whenever they are managed.  (It
    is the icon-window that needs to be mapped, not the top-level window.)

    With these fixes adwm not starts up nicely under the xdg-launch simple
    session manager that is about to be released and the soon to be finished
    xde-session full blown session manager.

git shortlog -e -n -w80,6,8 0.7.3...0.7.4

Brian Bidulock <bidulock@openss7.org> (7):
      yes, grab server for scan
      add startup notification completion for wm itself
      warn when not using prctl
      never block on wait
      do not handle core-dumpers
      unmap dockapp window
      update release files

Release adwm-0.7.2 released 2018-01-06
--------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.7.2

0.7.2           Stable Release 0.7.2

    This is a stable release that includes more todo's completed. Yes,
    there are still some outstanding, but nothing major. This release fixes
    one obnoxious behaviour: auto-exposing docks and panels when you
    overshoot browser scrollbars: there is now a default 500 millisecond
    delay before they are exposed. You need to rub the edge of the monitor
    with the pointer to get them to expose now.

    There are a lot of preparations in the code now for handling more
    graphics file formats and advanced rendering, but it is not yet
    complete. The stable ximage approach works well (if not the most
    efficient). I wanted to released the other fixes and improvements
    before working further on the graphics formats and rendering.

    As usual, Included is an autoconf tarball for building the package from
    source. Please report problems to the issues list on github.
