/** @brief save yourself callback
  *
  * The session manager sends a SaveYourself message to the client either to
  * checkpoint it or so that it can save its state.  The client responds with
  * zero or more calls to SmcSetProperties to update the properties indicating
  * how to restart the client.  When all the properties have been set, the
  * client calls SmcSaveYourselfDone.
  *
  * If #interactStyle is SmInteractStyleNone, the client must not interact with
  * the user while saving state.  If #interactStyle is SmInteractStyleErrors,
  * the client may interact with the user only if an error condition arises.  If
  * #interactStyle is SmInteractStyleAny, then the client may interact with the
  * user at any time, the client must call SmcInteractRequest and wait for an
  * Interact message from the session manager.  When the client is done
  * inteacting with the user, it calls SmcInteractDone.  The client may only
  * call SmcInteractRequest after it receives a SaveYourself message and before
  * it calls SmcSaveYourselfDone.
  *
  * If #saveType is SmSaveLocal, the client must update the properties to
  * reflect its current state.  Specifically, it should save enough information
  * to restore the state as seen by the user of this client.  It should not
  * affect the state as seen by other users.  If #saveType is SmSaveGlobal, the
  * user wants the client to commit all of its data to permanent, globally
  * accessible storage.  If #saveType is SmSaveBoth, the client should do both
  * of these (it should first commit the data to permanent storage before
  * updating its properies).
  *
  * The #shutdown argument specifies whether the system is being shut down.  The
  * interaction is different depending on whether or not shutdown is set.  If
  * not shutting down, the client should save its state and wait for a "Save
  * Complete" message.  If shutting down, the client must save state and then
  * prevent interaction until it receives either a "Die" or a "Shutdown
  * Cancelled".
  *
  * The #fast argument specifies that the client should save its state as
  * quickly as possible.  For example, if the session manager knows that power
  * is about to fail, it sould set #fast to True.
  *
  * During Phase 1 we need to ask any clients that only do X11R5 session
  * management and advertize WM_SAVE_YOURSELF in WM_PROTOCOLS to save themselves
  * and update their WM_COMMAND properties.  We will not be able to send
  * RequestSaveYourselfPhase2 until we are complete the former.  X11R5 clients
  * were not allowed to interact with the user during the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF
  * protocol, so there should be no problem with unwanted user interaction
  * occurring.
