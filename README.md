adwm
===============

Package `adwm-0.6.9` was released under GPLv3 license 2017-09-10.

This was originally a fork of Echinus which in turn was a fork of `dwm(1)`, and
borrows concepts from `velox(1)`, `awesome(1)` and `spectrwm(1)`.  The source
for `adwm` is hosted on [GitHub][1].  What it includes is a full
rewrite with significant updates and additions resulting in full EWMH (NetwM),
WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCCM 2.0 compliance and support.


Release
-------

This is the `adwm-0.6.9` package, released 2017-09-10.  This release, and
the latest version, can be obtained from [GitHub][1], using a command such as:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/adwm.git

Please see the [NEWS][3] file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the [ChangeLog][4] file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The [TODO][5] file lists features
not yet implemented and other outstanding items.

The file [COMPLIANCE][6] lists the current state of EWMH/ICCCM compliance.

Please see the [INSTALL][7] file for installation instructions.

installation procedure that works for most applications appears below.

    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure
    $> make
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install
