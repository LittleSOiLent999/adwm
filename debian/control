Description: lightweight tiling window manager
 echinus is a dynamic window manager for X11 supporting
 managing windows in floating, tiled and maximized
 layouts based on dwm. All the configuration is made
 via config file in Xresources format, so it is not
 necessary to recompile echinus every time you change
 something.
 echinus supports a small subset of EWMH to be
 compatible with external panels and pagers.
 It draws a border around windows and also an
 optional title bar. The goal of development is
 a small, fast window manager without features not
 strictly related to window management.
