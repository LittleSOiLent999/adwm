.TH FWM 1 fwm\-VERSION
.SH NAME
fwm \- f(?) window manager 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
fwm is a lightweight window manager for X based on dwm's source code.
It manages windows in maximized and floating layouts. Either layout
can be applied dynamically, optimizing the environment for the
application in use and the task performed.
.P
In maximized layout only one window can be seen at the moment, but you can switch
between them with hotkeys. In floating layout windows can be
resized and moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating,
regardless of the layout applied.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
fwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state and
an optional titlebar
