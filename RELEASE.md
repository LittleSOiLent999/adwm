=========================

This is another release of the adwm window manager that provdes a fully

`velox(1)`, `awesome(1)`, `spectrwm(1)` and `wmii(1)`.

This is a maintenance release that includes some build improvements and
a fix for issue #7 by forcing a make dependency between adwm-adwm.la and
adwm.  There are no outstanding issues at the time of release, and the
