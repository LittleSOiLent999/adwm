Stable Release 0.7.2
====================

This is a stable release that includes more todo's completed.  Yes, there are
still some outstanding, but nothing major.  This release fixes one obnoxious
behaviour: auto-exposing docks and panels when you overshoot browser
scrollbars: there is now a default 500 millisecond delay before they are
exposed.  You need to rub the edge of the monitor with the pointer to get them
to expose now.

There are a lot of preparations in the code now for handling more graphics
file formats and advanced rendering, but it is not yet complete.  The stable
ximage approach works well (if not the most efficient).  I wanted to released
the other fixes and improvements before working further on the graphics
formats and rendering.

As usual, Included is an autoconf tarball for building the package from
source.  Please report problems to the issues list on github.
