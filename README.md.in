[@PACKAGE@ -- read me first file.  @DATE@]: #

@PACKAGE@
====

Package `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` was released under GPL license @DATE@.

This was originally a fork of Echinus which in turn was a fork of `dwm(1)`, and
borrows concepts from `velox(1)`, `awesome(1)` and `spectrwm(1)`.  The source
for __`@PACKAGE@`__ is hosted on [GitHub][1].  What it includes is a full
rewrite with significant updates and additions resulting in full EWMH (NetwM),
WMH (WinWM), MWMH (CDE/Motif), ICCCM 2.0 compliance and support.


Release
-------

This is the `@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@` package, released @DATE@.  This release, and
the latest version, can be obtained from [GitHub][1], using a command such as:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git

Please see the [NEWS][3] file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the [ChangeLog][4] file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The [TODO][5] file lists features
not yet implemented and other outstanding items.  The file [COMPLIANCE][6]
lists the current state of XDG compliance.

Please see the [INSTALL][7] file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)`, follow the instructions in this file.  An
abbreviated installation procedure that works for most applications appears
below.

`echinus(1)` and `dwm(1)` were published under the MIT/X Consortium
License that can be found in the file [LICENSE][8].  As over 90% of the source
file lines have been supplied or replaced and the remaining 10% is not subject
to copyright, this release is published under the GPL license that can be found
in the file [COPYING][9].


Quick Start
-----------

The quickest and easiest way to get @PACKAGE@ up and running is to run the
following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git @PACKAGE@
    $> cd @PACKAGE@
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install @PACKAGE@ the quickest.  For those who
like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading `./configure --help`, some compile
time options can be turned on and off before the build.  @PACKAGE@, however,
does not provide any compile time options of its own.

For general information on GNU's `./configure`, see the file [INSTALL][7].


Running
-------

Read the manual page after installation:

    man @PACKAGE@
